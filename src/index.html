      <h2>Benefits of Using CSS Animations</h2>
    	<p>One major benefit of using CSS animations is that you don't need to know JavaScript!
        Even if you write JavaScript, you might not want to weigh your application down
        with unnecesasry extras when you need just a few minor enhancements. Most CSS
        animations often perform better than simple JavaScript animations. The browser
        itself can optimize and increase performance by adjusting the frame rate within
        its own rendering engine. This optimization allows most CSS animations to run
        more quickly and smoothly than their JavaScript counterparts.
