      <h2>Benefits of Using CSS Animations</h2>
    	<p>One major benefit of using CSS animations is that you don't need to know JavaScript!
        Even if you do write JavaScript, you might not want to weigh your application down
        with unnecesasry extras when you need just a few minor enhancements. Most CSS
        animations often perform better than simple JavaScript animations. The browser
        itself can optimize and increase performance by adjusting the frame rate within
        its own rendering engine. This optimization allows most CSS animations to run
        more quickly and smoothly than their JavaScript counterparts.

      <h2>Bounce Wit Me</h2>
      <p>So, what can you animate? Most elements on your page can be manipulated
        with animations and transformations. The sorcery behind these animations
        is in the keyframes that we assign to the elements. Keyframes are used to
        set the starting and ending states of each animation. The animation
        starts at 0% and ends at 100%, with any number of waypoints marked using
        any percentage in between.
      </p>

      <p>Below you can see a few of the animation styles available next to the
        code that created them. Each example utilizes multiple subclasses in order
        to achieve the final effect.  </p>

    <!-- <p class=col-lg-12>It is also important to note the difference between the individually listed
      animation attributes above and the shorthand syntax in the example below.
      When using the <code>animation:</code> tag, attributes can be strung together
      using commas provided they are listed in the correct order.
