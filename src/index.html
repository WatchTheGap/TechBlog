      <h2 class='rubberBand'>So....What am I looking at?</h2>
      <p class='mainText'>CSS animations are a simple, fun way to add some character to the user experience.
      Gone are the days of littering one's homepage with animated GIFs and loads of
      infinitely scrolling and blinking text. Maybe not gone, persay, but at the very
      least, most of the supurfluous glittering nonesense is now being executed with
      CSS and JavaScript tricks rather than tons of bulky images that need to be loaded and
      continuously rendered. </p>
    </main>
    <main class='container'>
      <h2>Why would I use these things?</h2>
      <p class='mainText'>Guess what? You don't need to know JavaScript to use CSS animations!
        Even if you do write JavaScript, you might not want to weigh your application down
        with unnecesasry extras when you need just a few minor enhancements. CSS
        animations often perform better than simple JavaScript animations. The browser
        itself can optimize and increase performance by adjusting the frame rate within
        its own rendering engine. This optimization allows most CSS animations to run
        more quickly and smoothly than their JavaScript counterparts.

      <h2 class='bounceInDown'>Bounce With Me</h2>
      <p class='mainText'>So, what can you animate? Most elements on your page can be manipulated
        with animations and transformations that alter the element's color, size,
        shape, or location. The
        <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations'>sorcery</a>
        behind these animations is in the keyframes
        assigned to the elements. Keyframes are used to set the starting and
        ending states of each animation. The animation starts at 0% and ends at
        100%, with any number of waypoints marked using any percentage in between.
      </p>
      <h2>Avert your eyes...</h2>
      <p class='mainText'>Here are a couple of
        <a href='https://robots.thoughtbot.com/css-animation-for-beginners'>examples</a>
        of the animation styles that are available
        next to the code that created them. Each example utilizes multiple subclasses
        in order to achieve the final effect. It is important to note the difference
        between the individually listed animation attributes in the <code>bounce</code>
        example and the shorthand syntax used in the <code>spin</code> example.
        When using the <code>animation:</code> tag, attributes can be strung
        together using commas provided they are listed in the correct order. </p>

        <h2>'Tis one thing to be tempted, another thing to fall.</h2>
        <p class='mainText'>It is easy to get carried away with animations once you've lifted the lid
          from Pandora's Box. In researching animation ettiquette and

          Used intentionally as an engaging or interactive enhancement, CSS animations,
          offer the opportunity to elevate both the design and
          the user experience of a website.
